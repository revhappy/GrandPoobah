    <h2>Challenges and Impact</h2>
  </div>
      <h2>Challenges and Impact on Society</h2>
      <p>One of the challenges Robb faced in his life is growing up poor and earning respect from his peers through grit rather than connections. His impact on society is driving transportation and housing costs to approach zero. He is extremely distrustful of mainstream media and will not give any interviews. He is a libertarian, and while his ideal society would be anarchism, he recognizes that most of humanity is not quite there yet and respects authority figures too much.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Personal Beliefs</h2>
      <p>Robb relates closest to the principles of fundamental Hinduism and Buddhism, and respects Christianity and the community of catholicism. He tries to leave the planet cleaner than he found it. Over time, he got rid of some of his idealism but not all, as he believes that it is his superpower. His biggest achievement is changing attitudes and showing that success is 99% failure. </p>
      <p>Robb's vision for the future is abundance and approaching anarchism. Currently, he is a lifelong monk.</p>

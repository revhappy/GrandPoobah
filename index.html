His impact on society is driving transportation and housing costs to approach zero. He is extremely distrustful of mainstream media and will not give any interviews.

      <p>Robb relates closest to the principles of fundamental Hinduism and Buddhism, and respects Christianity and the community of catholicism.

His biggest achievement is changing attitudes and showing that success is 99% failure. </p>
